# pygame-demos

I decided to start doing this for \#100daysofcode.

Will be blogging about it here. Easier than posting to my website, which will be going down and rebuilt as a flask-app soon anyway.

- Day 1. demo1.py: A simple 4-panel color display. A lot of this was ripped out of a previous project template, but is organized well enough that it can be grafted onto easily.
