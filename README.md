# pygame-demos

I decided to start doing this for \#100daysofcode.

Will be blogging about it here. Easier than posting to my website, which will be going down and rebuilt as a flask-app soon anyway.

- Day 1 - 6/28/2019: demo1.py: A simple 4-panel color display. A lot of this was ripped out of a previous project template, but is organized well enough that it can be grafted onto easily.
- Day 2 - 6/29/2019: demo2.py: Renders a randomly-colored 20x20 square that follows the mouse cursor. When clicked, cycles thru other random-colors.
    - *9:12pm*: I have an idea that I'm gonna add onto this right now! Will blog when done...
